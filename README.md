# Petar Djukic

Principal Architect building agentic orchestration systems in Go.

I specialize in **Architecture-First Development** — defining system structure before code generation, so AI implements rather than decides. Twenty years of production systems experience, 64 US patents, PhD in Computer Engineering.

## Current Focus

- **Orchestration:** Self-managing agent loops where the human writes intent, the system proposes and implements
- **Context Engineering:** Token-efficient workflows for large-scale code generation
- **MCP:** Model Context Protocol servers for production tooling

## Projects

**[mcp-calc](https://github.com/petar-djukic/mcp-calc)** — A production-grade MCP server and agent built with AI orchestration. 8,000 lines of Go, fully tested. The three commands that built it are [open source](https://github.com/petar-djukic/mcp-calc/tree/main/.claude/commands).

**[idea-factory](https://github.com/petar-djukic/idea-factory)** — My personal agentic workspace. The `.claude/commands/` directory is the core artifact: custom Claude skills that compose into a crude orchestrator.

## Writing

I write about the mechanics of building production systems with AI at [Mesh Intelligence](https://meshintelligence.substack.com).
